You upload a photo of a face, check a box agreeing to the terms of service and then get a grid of photos of faces deemed similar, with links to where they appear on the internet. The New York Times used PimEyes on the faces of a dozen Times journalists, with their consent, to test its powers.PimEyes found photos of every person, some that the journalists had never seen before, even when they were wearing sunglasses or a mask, or their face was turned away from the camera, in the image used to conduct the search. PimEyes found one reporter dancing at an art museum event a decade ago, and crying after being proposed to, a photo that she didn’t particularly like but that the photographer had decided to use to advertise his business on Yelp. A tech reporter’s younger self was spotted in an awkward crush of fans at the Coachella music festival in 2011. A foreign correspondent appeared in countless wedding photos, evidently the life of every party, and in the blurry background of a photo taken of someone else at a Greek airport in 2019.

Shortly after the incident was reported, Ather’s official Twitter handle confirmed the fire while saying that no employee was harmed during the incident.According to a statement issued by the company later, the incident happened due to a vehicle that was brought into the showroom for servicing after it had an accident. Since there was a lot of dust and mud on the vehicle, the staff at the service centre reportedly used a high-pressure water wash to clean the vehicle before inspecting it.Ather says that the service team discovered some cracks in the top casing of the battery pack. But by then, water had entered the battery casing due to the high-pressure wash. The company says that letting in water into the battery is an “impossible to solve scenario,” and that the scooter was “moved to a safer area,” as soon as this was observed."

    "description": "The UK’s antitrust watchdog started a new investigation of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, over suspicions it may have abused its dominant position across its ad tech that goes to the heart of the tech giant’s business model.The move by the Competition and Markets Authority opens a fresh front in its regulatory tussle with Google. The CMA said it was concerned Google sought to illegally favor its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind pay walls,” said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive Officer.Watchdogs around the world have started to home in on the huge power that firms such as Google and Meta’s Facebook wield over ad markets — striking at the heart of the tech giants’ money making machines. Google faces a separate probe by the CMA into possible collusion over the way it operates online display advertising services.The CMA has been examining the way Google buys and sells advertising since at least 2020, saying that its advertising stack is a potential conflict of interest. It’s called for powers that would even allow for a structural changes."

    "description": "Sooraj Pancholi, who loves to work out, is back to the fitness grind after long. His fitness trainer, Pawan Jatwa, recently shared a video in which the Hero actor could be seen flexing his muscles. According to Bala Krishna Reddy Dabbedi, a fitness expert, and co-founder, director at Fittr, people usually think that they can pick up from where they left and that their original strength will be the same — “but that will not be the case”. “It’s easy to compare yourself to the times when you were training regularly. But, if there has been a gap in your gymming routine, it’s reasonable to see a decline in strength, endurance, and overall muscle,” he expressed.Assess again, test your current strength levels and train accordingly, he suggested. “There is something called muscle memory which helps one get back to their previous strength levels and muscle mass, but this takes times — from a few weeks to even some months. Just be consistent and positive till you get there. On resuming, do not start with an intense program. Keep it minimal, start slow, and you may even experience muscle soreness and pain. Eventually increase the intensity with every passing week,” she said."

    "description": "Being physically active can help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A recent study in Diabetes Care found that women who get more steps have a lower risk of developing diabetes, compared to women who are more sedentary.1And a study in the journal Metabolites found that men who are more active have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to men who are more sedentary.2 It seems that physical activity significantly changes the body’s metabolite profile, and many of these changes are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, says Maria Lankinen, PhD, research scientist, Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland, and one of the researchers on the study published in Metabolites. Increased physical activity also improved insulin secretion.The study published in Diabetes Care focused on 4,838 older women (median age 78.9) without diabetes, who were followed for up to 6.9 years. Their steps were monitored by accelerometers to account for the number of steps and the intensity of steps, which were labeled as light-intensity or moderate- to vigorous-intensity.For diabetes among older adults, our findings indicate that moderate- to vigorous-intensity steps were more strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetes than light-intensity steps, adds John Bellettiere, PhD, an assistant professor of family medicine and public health at UC San Diego, and a co-author on the study."

    "description": "With summers already here, who doesn’t want to thoroughly enjoy the seasonal fruits that come with it. But if you have diabetes, then you must have been told countless times to consume fruits with utmost caution. Seasonal fruits like watermelon and grapes are high in glycemic index (GI), and thus with it comes the question — Can a diabetic have fruits? Is it safe?However, bursting the myth, a diabetic can enjoy fruits, but simply need to make strategic decisions based on fruit and how much to consume as per its GI as it assists the person in selecting fruit.  Fruits like watermelon have a glycemic index (GI) of 72 per 100 g serving, but one watchful serving of the fruit contains little carbs and will have minimal effect on the blood sugar level.It is safe to consume blackberries, apples, avocados, strawberries, plums, grapefruit, peaches, pears, and cherries in watchful quantity as they have 20-49 GI levels, which technically classifies them as low GI fruit. With lots of fibre and a low GI, these fruits help improve blood sugar tolerance.People who have diabetes are usually advised to keep an eye on the number of carbohydrates and portion size of their meal, even if it contains low GI, which is indeed true. While consuming fruits certain factors such as the ripeness of the fruit that influences its GI should be taken into account."

Not only as spices, but ginger has been a traditional remedy in many cultures for thousands of years. After all, it is loaded with impeccable health benefits. While we have been told time and again that ginger carries innumerable nutritious benefits, it’s rarely discussed that this magical ingredient can also cause side effects.Although the side effects usually happen after excessive intake of ginger, several cases have been witnessed where it aggravates the health issues. So let’s learn more about the side effects.As ginger carries antiplatelet properties, excessive intake of ginger may cause bleeding. Not just this, but if it is consumed with clove or garlic, it further increases the risk of excessive bleeding.The most common symptoms of basic side effects caused by excessive ginger intake are skin rashes, eye redness, dyspnea, itching, swollen lips, itchy eyes, and throat discomfort. In such circumstances, it is advised to immediately seek medical attention.Consuming ginger beyond the prescribed limit of 1500 mg per day may even lead to the risk of miscarriage. Therefore it is advised to avoid too much ginger during pregnancy and intake it only after consulting the doctor"

    "description": "When we wake up, the first thing that comes to put mind is what to have for breakfast. After finishing it, we start thinking about lunch and then about dinner. This shows that food is one of the most important parts of our lives. One day we skip a meal, and our body starts reacting in a different way. While what we eat matters, another thing that plays a part is when we eat our meals. The time of having breakfast, lunch and dinner are vital to determine many health benefits. There is a common saying, “Early to bed, early to rise, makes us healthy, wealthy and wise.” Let’s turn it up a little and say, early dinner and early breakfast are all you need to be healthy and smart.Breakfast: Breakfast is the first meal of the day which makes our guts wake up. Usually, breakfast is eaten after 8 to 10 hours of having our dinner. The best time to have the first meal of the day is between 7 am to 9 am.Lunch: When you eat your breakfast early, it gives your stomach enough time to rest before you go on to your lunch. This aids digestion of breakfast. The best time to have lunch is between 12 noon to 2 pm. Dinner: As you have had your lunch early, you might feel hungry soon in the evening. Many dieticians recommend having early dinner in order to satisfy our hunger as well as boost metabolism. You should have your dinner between 6.30 pm to 8 pm.  If you have all your meals on a scheduled time daily, then it can help you boost your metabolism. In the morning, your metabolic rate works best, and as the day passes, it slows down. Therefore, having an early breakfast gives it a boost and an early dinner help it sustain."

    "description": "​​ How soon we renounce age-old traditions in the praxis of food, and succumb to the allure of convenience, short cuts, and finished good-looking products. I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens."

They are said to be the best way to provide nutrition to the body and boost immunity. Every season comes with a variety of grains, vegetables, and fruits and we can’t agree more that they are tastier than the stored ones. However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic."

    "description": "If you are a fitness enthusiast and a vegan, you might be one of the people who have tofu in their meals instead of paneer. While many people find it easily in the supermarket, others may find it difficult to spot tofu at their local stores. If you are one of those people, don’t worry as this simple method can help you make protein-rich tofu at home with just two ingredients – chickpeas and water.Once the tofu is set, you can use it as and when required. It is as tasty as the tofu bought from a store and tofu is as versatile as cottage cheese. It can be used in dry and wet recipes depending on your mood and diet requirements. Chickpea is rich in protein and hence the tofu is a great source of protein to help you complete the daily protein requirement.Soak the chickpeas overnight after thoroughly washing with the help of a strainer under running water.Drain all the water and wash the chickpeas the next day. Add chickpeas with two cups of water in a blender and blend in batches until you have a smooth mixture.Strain the blended chickpeas through a muslin cloth into a bowl. Make a squeezable bag out of the muslin cloth with the mixture in it. Squeeze the blend well to strain it nicely. As the water drains slowly from the mixture, it takes some time to strain the blend.Take the strained blend and put it in a pot. Keep the pot on full flame and let the mixture boil. Once you see bubbles, lower the flame and cook the blend for another half n hour. The mixture will thicken with time. When it is thick enough, put off the flame and let the blend cool down for a while. Leave the mixture in a container for more than 2 hours idle. This will ensure that the mixture sits and the tofu sets properly"
